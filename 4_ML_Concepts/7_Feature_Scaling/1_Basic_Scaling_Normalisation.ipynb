    "### Normalizing and Scaling\n",
    "- Often the variables of the data set are of different scales i.e. one variable is in millions and others in only 100. For e.g. in our data set Income is having values in thousands and age in just two digits. Since the data in these variables are of different scales, it is tough to compare these variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Feature scaling (also known as data normalization) is the method used to standardize the range of features of data. Since the range of values of data may vary widely, it becomes a necessary step in data preprocessing while using machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this method, we convert variables with different scales of measurements into a single scale. StandardScaler normalizes the data using the formula (x-mean)/standard deviation. We will be doing this only for the numerical variables."
