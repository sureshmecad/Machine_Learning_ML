Feature Scaling / Standard Scalar:

  Age and Estimated salary are in different units. 
       Age is in no of yrs
       Estimated salary in INR (or) Dollars (or) Euros

  We need to bring down all these values into same scaling.




----> is it compulsory to do scaling for tree based algorithms?

      Why is he standardizing when he is using Random Forest,which has no concept of eucledian distance?

          - no, as per the rule it is not advisable to do scaling in tree based algo( but no one is stopping you to do that.) it wont be useful anyway.

          - Not required. Because decision tree makes decision based on the label and the tree traversal to a node will be same when you do with/without scaling.

  you did not use ".values" while defining X&y.(you did not need an array). But here you have. Would you kindly explain why and when should one use ".values" in general?


       I will use .values only when i need the dataset in array form. The reason i convert into arrays is that if we are using sklearn libraries it is always better to give in the array format
